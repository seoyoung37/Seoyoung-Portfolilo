        We gathered our own sketches. <br><br>
        <strong>Kevin's background:</strong> My character design is based off traditional masked wrestlers. Once regarded as one of the most promising wrestlers of his generation and at the cusp of success with a top worldwide promotion, bad decisions and a troubled past catch up with him, leaving the wrestling world to witness his fall into obscurity. A magical mask unearthed from the condemned rubble of his childhood gym grants him the power to never miss any wrestling moves – at a grave cost. Now towards the tail-end of his career, he aims to regain the passion that he had lost, and in the process tries to find what it truly means to be a professional wrestler.

        <strong>Chaehyun's background:</strong> First, I wanted to create a non-human character rather than a human one, so I based it on a cat, which I think is one of the most charming animals to turn into a character. After that, I reflected some of my own traits in it. Since my existing original character had a mischievous little devil concept, I borrowed that theme again. I think being stubborn and playful fits well with a cat. I also incorporated my nickname, the “ice-element alien.” I don’t usually feel cold, I like eating cold things even in winter, and since my hands and feet are always cold, people started calling me that… (There’s a longer story about why I’m called an alien, but I’ll stop here for now.. haha)
        <br><br>
        We decided to draw our own head part and mix the body and leg part. I had to combine my head, Kevin's body and Chaehyun's leg part.
