      <p class="description">
        I wanted to express time through the human body itself. Since we can already measure time through our natural biorhythms, I used blinking as the unit of a second—each blink signaling the passage of time. For hours, I represented the state of the eyes: opening in the morning, being the most alert and clear at midday, gradually becoming smaller in the evening, and finally closing at night.
        <br><br>
        I also expressed hunger cycles as a way of showing the passage of an hour: the belly gradually expands for 30 minutes as hunger builds, and then flattens again over the next 30 minutes after eating.
        <br><br>
        The background color was used to represent the sky. Although the background may feel less directly connected to the body, it reflects the reality that we always live within a surrounding environment. Using lerpColor, the sky transitions gradually across time zones—6–12, 12–18, 18–21, 21–24, and 24–06—so the atmosphere shifts smoothly throughout the day.
        <br><br>
        This design emphasizes the novelty of perceiving time without relying on any external, objective clock—showing that “I,” the human body itself, can be the measure of time.
